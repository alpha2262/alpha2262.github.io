<h5>Web Development Immersive at General Assembly</h5>
  <p>I came to GA to learn the "how" behind programming. I loved working with my development team, however I felt I was not able to contribute as much with my skill set (program manager and analyst by background) since I didn't have a thorough understanding of the time it takes set up everything from databases to the user interface in front of it.
    Now I'm able to build prototypes, make API calls, and have a better understanding of the intricacies and even more importantly potential pitfalls of an approach to solving a problem. I feel I now understand the basics behind software engineering and writing beautiful code.
